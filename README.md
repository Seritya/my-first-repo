## About

I'm quite new to all of this and most of the time I have no idea, what I'm doing... I'm a teacher for History and German in Switzerland and coding is something I really like to keep my mind busy.


## Reading

Asking me about my favourite book is like asking an astronomer about her favourite star... But here are some I really like:
- Dresden Files (the whole series)
- The name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss
- Emelan by Tamora Pierce

## Contact

I have a [website](www.angela.renggli.ch) where you can find everything you need.
